### 1. Network Topology
 
#### 1.1 Physical Topology
<img width="1916" height="802" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bdc3fba-a208-4318-83d2-e4a07e70a425" />
 
 
* **Focus:** A centralized, rack-mounted approach for core equipment with structured cabling to endpoints.

* **Core Equipment Location:** A dedicated, locked server closet or data cabinet is recommended for the Firewall/Router, Managed Switch, and Server.

* **Wiring:** All permanent devices (PCs, POS terminals, Printers, Access Points) must be connected using **Cat6 Ethernet cable** running through a Patch Panel in the closet, connecting to the Managed Switch.

* **Endpoints:**

  *  PCs and POS devices are wired for maximum reliability and speed.

  *  Wireless Access Points (APs) are ceiling-mounted and PoE-powered from the switch to provide office-wide $\text{Wi-Fi}$ coverage.
 
#### 1.2 Logical Topology
<img width="1536" height="1024" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31c1eaa8-8701-4408-bc89-44aaae9f31b8" />
 
#### 1.3 Network Topology Summary ###

* Two routers (R1, R2) each connected redundantly to two core switches (SW1, SW2).

* SW1 <-> SW2: 2x parallel links aggregated with LACP (Port-Channel) to avoid STP flapping.

* R1 and R2 present router-on-a-stick subinterfaces (802.1Q trunk) for VLANs.

* HSRP for default-gateway high-availability across VLANs.

### 4. Devices Configurations (Summary)

The full configuration files will be stored securely, but key configurations are summarized here:

* **Firewall/Router Configuration**

  * **Default Deny:** The firewall is configured to block all incoming traffic (WAN to LAN) by default.

  * **Inter-VLAN Routing:** Rules are applied to block VLAN 20 (POS) and VLAN 100(Guest) from accessing VLAN 80 (Servers) entirely.

     **Security:** Web filtering and IPS are enabled.

* **Core Switch Configuration**

  * **VLAN Tagging:** All uplink ports (to Firewall/Router and APs) are configured as Trunk Ports carrying VLANs 10, 20, 80, 99, 100.

  * **Access Ports:** Ports are statically assigned to the required VLAN:

    * PCs ports: Access VLAN 10

    * POS ports: Access VLAN 10

    * PoE: Enabled on ports connecting to APs and potentially VoIP phones.

**Wireless Access Point Configuration**

  * **SSID Mapping:**

      * **Trendy-Data** ->VLAN 10 (WPA2-Enterprise authentication via DC-Server)

      * **Trendy-WLAN** ->VLAN 99 (WPA2-PSK for employee mobile)

      * **Trendy-Guest** ->VLAN 90 (Captive Portal enabled)

### 5. Management & Security

* **INFRA_MGMT (VLAN 70)**

  * Devices: PC01 (admin workstation), router/firewall interfaces, switch SVIs

  * Purpose: Restricted access for IT staff only

* **Security Features**

  * ACLs applied to POS VLANs (only allowed to reach Inventory Server + Internet)

  * HSRP for router redundancy

  * LACP trunk between core switches for loop prevention

  * Guest VLAN isolated via WLC with Internet-only access

#### 5.1 Secure Credential Storage

The method used to securely store all administrative login credentials (Firewall, Switch, APs, Server Admin accounts, ERP passwords) is:

* **Method:** A centralized, business-grade, encrypted *Password Manager* (e.g., Bitwarden Teams or 1Password Business) is implemented.

* **Access:** Access to the Password Manager requires a unique master password for each administrator user, combined with MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication).

* **Repository:** The actual passwords are not stored in the GitHub documentation repository. Only this methodology and the necessary unprivileged user account names are documented.

* **Principle:** Credentials are encrypted in transit and at rest using strong standards like AES-256 and are only decrypted locally on authorized administrator workstations.

 
**IP convention for DCHP/DNS**

* .1 = HSRP/VRRP virtual gateway

* .2 = R1 subinterface

* .3 = R2 subinterface

* .10 - .19 = Reserved for servers/infrastructure reservations

* .100–.200 → DHCP pool for clients

#### 5. Post-Installation Configuration (BKUP01)

Once Windows Server 2022 is installed on the BKUP01 VM and you have logged in, these are the critical steps to integrate it properly into your ict.margielos.uk domain and the SERVERS network.

* **i Install VirtIO and Qemu Guest Agent**

Before proceeding with networking, ensure the VM has the optimized drivers and communication agent installed.

  * **Open File Explorer** and navigate to the mounted VirtIO ISO drive (e.g., D: or E:).

  * **Install the **VirtIO drivers** using the installer provided on the ISO.

  * Install the **Qemu Guest Agent.** This service allows Proxmox to accurately monitor the VM's resource usage, send clean shutdown commands, and report the correct IP address in the Proxmox UI.

* **ii Configure Static IP Addressing**

The VM must be configured with a static IP address to ensure reliable connectivity and DNS resolution.

  * **Open Network Connections** (e.g., via ncpa.cpl).

  * Right-click the network adapter and select Properties.

  * Select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) and click Properties.

  * Select Use the following IP address and enter the details:
 
|Field|Value|

|----|----|

|**IP Address**|192.168.80.14|

|**Subnet Mask**|255.255.255.0|

|**Default Gateway**|192.168.80.1|

|**Preferred DNS Server**|192.168.80.11 (DC01)|

|**Alternate DNS Server**|192.168.80.12 (DC02)|

  * **iii Change Server Name and Join Domain**

This step registers the server with your domain and sets the correct hostname.

* **Open System Properties** (e.g., via sysdm.cpl).

* In the **Computer Name** tab, click **Change...**

* **Computer name:** Enter**BKUP01**.

* **Member of:** Select **Domain** and enter the domain name: **ict.margielos.uk.**.

* Click **OK.** You will be prompted for credentials (use a domain admin account, like ict\administrator).

* You will receive a welcome message, and the server will prompt you to **Restart** the VM.

* After the restart, you should be able to log in using domain credentials (e.g., ICT\YourAdminUsername).

* **iv Basic System Configuration**

Perform these administrative tasks for a complete setup.

  * **Windows Updates:** Install all necessary patches and updates.

  * **Time Zone:** Set the correct time zone for the server.

  * **Firewall:** Configure the Windows Firewall to allow necessary traffic (e.g., backup application ports, ICMP for monitoring, RDP).

  * **Remote Desktop (RDP):** Ensure RDP is enabled so you can manage the server remotely without using the Proxmox console.

* **v. Storage Preparation (If Applicable)** If you have allocated additional virtual disks for backup storage (separate from the boot disk):

    * **Open Disk Management** (e.g., via diskmgmt.msc).

    * The new disk(s) should appear as Unallocated.

    * **Initialize** the disk (GPT is recommended for modern systems).

    * **Create a New Simple Volume** on the disk, format it with NTFS or ReFS (ReFS is often preferred for large backup volumes), and assign a drive letter (e.g., B: for Backups).
